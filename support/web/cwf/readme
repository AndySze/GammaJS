CWF
===

This is a layer that sits on top of django and aims to make life a bit easier. It aims to provide the following functionality

    * Create menu structure and urlconf at the same time
    * Make the menustructure inside your templates using this information
    * Use classes to hold your views, which allows some nice abstraction and other features

You'll also notice the storage folder which provides functionality that is unrelated to the Gamma project. Whilst it does work, I dislike it and plan to rewrite it in the future.

Current Status
==============

The version found here is quite old and I have rewritten cwf, however until I release it to the wild (which will happen eventually), I'll continue to use the old version for this project.
